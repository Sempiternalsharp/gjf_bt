Bluetooth stack bitrate changer + aptX & aptX-HD Enabler Module.
Increases stack bitrate and enables aptX.
Tested on Redmi 4X. Possibly (???) works on other devices.
NO WORK on Lineage and Lineage-based ROMs (AICP etc).

## Requirements ##
- Redmi 4x??? Let me know if your device works or not. Blacklist will be formed based on your replies.
- MIUI 10 or any Android >=7

## Details ##
BT stack is modified in the way so it uses:
- Dual Channel for any audio connection
- Maximum bitrate depending on your choice during installation. Test it on your headphones. Normally 454 kbit/s is OK with any headphones, personally I use 576 kbit/s without any problems. If something is not working - just re-install the module with new bitrate os uninstall it completely.

Most likely Lineage OS and Lineage-based OS (like AICP) are not supported - please let me know if Bluetooth cannot be switched on after installing this module. In this case simply delete the module and reboot - everything will be restored.
